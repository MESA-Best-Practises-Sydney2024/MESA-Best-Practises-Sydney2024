MESA Best Practices 
###############################

MESA microlabs for the morning session of Day 3 of the `MESA Down Under <https://maygpedersen.github.io/mesa-down-under-2024/>`__ 2024 School, Sydney, Australia.
This lecture is based on the MESA best practices discussed in the `MESA docs <https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/using_mesa/best_practices.html>`__.

We will use MESA Explorer to plot MESA output online, but alternatively <a href="plot_model.py">this Python script</a> can be used (by your TA). You can use this <a href="publish.mplstyle">this style file</a> to generate nice-looking plots. Do not waste time trying to run this Python script though.

.. warning::

    It should be noted that these labs are designed to run fast enough for the exercise sessions, and that the resolution may be too poor for scientific purposes! 



Lecturer: Joey Mombarg

Lab tester: Annachiara Picco
